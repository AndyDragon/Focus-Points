Contributing as a Developer
=======
Thank you for considering to contribute to the project. To make things go smoother for all involved, please try to follow the guidelines here. 

1. Before you begin work, file an Issue in Github with whatever it is you want to do. If the Issue is for changing a feature for personal prefernce, get approval before starting. If not, it's possible the code/change will not be accepted. If the Issue is a bug fix, it will most likely be accepted. 
2. All Pull Requests must have an Issue and focus on a single task. Pull Requests which change multiple things will not be accepted. 
3. Follow the naming convention that's already in place such as helloWorld and not hello_world.
